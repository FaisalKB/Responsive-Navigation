# Responsive-Navigation
## A demonstration of modern responsive headers embedded with navigation.
Some common components of websites can be tricky to build if you don't know the methodology behind them. One of those tricky components is navigation; building a responsive navigation requires a bit of knowledge of how it's typically done.
Building navigation in responsive web design can be challengingâ€”especially while maintaining a consistent look, feel, and experience on your site. There are many different ways to build and style a responsive navigation. This repository showcases the power of modern CSS in the form of a website header and navigation. This project incorporates tools and concepts such as:

### Mobile-First Approach:
Progressive enhancement (Also known as Mobile-First Approach) involves designing for the smallest screen first, then progressively adding features and rearranging the layout to take advantage of larger screen sizes.

As it turns out, progressive enhancement ensures that there is a good enough user experience on all screens. Designing your pages to work on smaller screens first is the generally accepted approach to making web pages today.

### Media queries:
Media queries are essentially an 'if' statement for CSS. A condition is set, and if that condition is met, then the CSS rules within it will be applied. Typically, media queries are used for changing the CSS of a website based on screen size.

With a simple media query, you can quickly provide a responsive layout to nearly any standard website by changing how the website looks based on if you're viewing on a mobile phone, tablet or computer.
